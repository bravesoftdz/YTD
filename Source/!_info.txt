HOW TO BUILD YTD
----------------

Several batch files for building YTD are provided:

  build.bat .......... Main build script. You can control the build options,
                       such as compiler used or specific features, using
                       arguments such as "delphi" or "nogui". You can get
                       a list of the most important arguments using argument
                       -h (or -?).

  build-locale.bat ... Script for building a new .pot file for translators.
                       It requires that DxGetText http://dxgettext.po.dk is
                       installed and set up in PATH.
                       (This script really should be a part of build.bat,
                       but I wanted to keep it separate for the people who
                       don't want to install DxGetText.)

  build-rel.bat ...... Quick script for building a release. It builds and
                       compresses the regular version, the Lite version and
                       the sources. It is unlikely you'll ever want or need
                       to use this script.

  clean.bat .......... Delete all unneeded files - backup files, compiled unit
                       files, IDE trash etc.

Below you'll find notes on building with specific compilers. If a compiler is
not listed here, I didn't try it and you are on your own (though I would
appreciate any feedback regarding builds using these compilers). You can

Delphi 5
--------

- Main development platform, should always work, with all features.



Delphi 2009
-----------

- Main platform for releases. Generally works, but may still have unexpected 
  side-effects due to Unicode in places.



Delphi XE4
----------

- Works, rarely tested.



Free Pascal
-----------

- Works, rarely tested.
- Can only use the WinAPI GUI, VCL is not supported.
- Use the "fpc" argument.
